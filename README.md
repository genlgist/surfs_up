# Overview

# Deliverable 1 - Determine the Summary Statistics for June

I used Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, to filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. I then converted those temperatures to a list, created a DataFrame from the list, and generated the summary statistics.

# Deliverable 2 - Determine the Summary Statistics for December

I used Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, to filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December. I then converted those temperatures to a list, created a DataFrame from the list, and generated the summary statistics.
